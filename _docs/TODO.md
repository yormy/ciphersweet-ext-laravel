# Decryption
how to determine if encrypted
when database is encrypted the platform no longer works, as de code expects an encryption but the db is not encryted
idea: env to set ether to use it or not.

# Decrypt entire database
collection of models

# decrypt 1 value ? in console for debugging
or specify the table and id to get the decrypted value on screen
or specify the model (more complex thant table) and get on screen
